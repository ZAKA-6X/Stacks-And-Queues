# Stacks And Queues:

Stacks and Queues are two fundamental data structures used to manage collections of elements and data in computer science.

### Stacks:

A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

Example: Think of a stack of books. You add books on top of each other, and when you want to remove a book, you take the one from the top.

### Queues:

A queue follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

Example: Consider a queue of people waiting in line. The person who joined the line first is the first one to be served.
